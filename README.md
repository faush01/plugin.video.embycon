# EmbyCon ![Version number](https://img.shields.io/github/release/faush01/plugin.video.embycon.svg?label=version&style=flat-square) ![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/faush01/plugin.video.embycon.svg?style=flat-square)

**EmbyCon is a lightweight [Kodi] addon that lets you browse and play media files from your [Emby] server directly within your beloved Kodi interface.**

The key difference with its sibling [Emby for Kodi] addon is that EmbyCon does not perform any heavy synchronization between Kodi and the Emby server: instead, it **requests, fetches and caches** all the information it needs from the server **on demand**.

## Installation

### From official **Kodi** addon repository

This is the **easiest** and **safest** way of installing EmbyCon, but it does not give access to [EmbyCon SkinCloner] nor to [EmbyCon ScreenSaver]:

### From **Emby** Kodi addon repository

This installation method will require to perform a few additional configuation tricks, but it will also let you install [EmbyCon SkinCloner] nor to [EmbyCon ScreenSaver]:

## Configuration

You can access the addon configuration pages from Kodi's main menu by heading to the "Addons browser", finding "EmbyCon" and go to the "Configure" page.

This includes the Emby server connection information as well as playback, interface, remote control and other advanced options.
